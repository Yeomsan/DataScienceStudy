# Perceptrons

* Perceptron (or Perceptron algorithm) is a sort of classifier that take a number of inputs and get a binary boolean output.
* Neural Network, Deep Learning is based on this simple perceptron.
* The basic principle of perceptron is to multiply different weight at each inputs, sums them up and put it into a nonlinear function.
* Perceptrons can be layered so that "Multi-layer Perceptrons" come out.
